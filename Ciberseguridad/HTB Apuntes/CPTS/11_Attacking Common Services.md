# Interacting with Common Services

Vulnerabilities are commonly discovered by people who use and understand technology, a protocol, or a service. As we evolve in this field, we will find different services to interact with, and we will need to evolve and learn new technology constantly.

To be successful at attacking a service, we need to know its purpose, how to interact with it, what tools we can use, and what we can do with it. This section will focus on common services and how we can interact with them.
## File Share Services

A file sharing service is a type of service that provides, mediates, and monitors the transfer of computer files. Years ago, businesses commonly used only internal services for file sharing, such as SMB, NFS, FTP, TFTP, SFTP, but as cloud adoption grows, most companies now also have third-party cloud services such as Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, SharePoint, or other forms of file storage such as AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, or Google Cloud Storage. We will be exposed to a mixture of internal and external file-sharing services, and we need to be familiar with them.

This section will focus on internal services, but this may apply to cloud storage synced locally to servers and workstations.
## Server Message Block (SMB)

SMB is commonly used in Windows networks, and we will often find share folders in a Windows network. We can interact with SMB using the GUI, CLI, or tools. Let us cover some common ways of interacting with SMB using Windows & Linux.
#### Windows

There are different ways we can interact with a shared folder using Windows, and we will explore a couple of them. On Windows GUI, we can press `[WINKEY] + [R]` to open the Run dialog box and type the file share location, e.g.: `\\192.168.220.129\Finance\`

![Windows Server 2012 R2 desktop with Run dialog open, showing network path entry.](https://cdn.services-k8s.prod.aws.htb.systems/content/modules/116/windows_run_sharefolder2.jpg)

Suppose the shared folder allows anonymous authentication, or we are authenticated with a user who has privilege over that shared folder. In that case, we will not receive any form of authentication request, and it will display the content of the shared folder.

![File explorer open to network path \192.168.220.133\Finance showing Contracts folder.](https://cdn.services-k8s.prod.aws.htb.systems/content/modules/116/finance_share_folder2.jpg)

If we do not have access, we will receive an authentication request.

Windows has two command-line shells: the [Command shell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/windows-commands) and [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview). Each shell is a software program that provides direct communication between us and the operating system or application, providing an environment to automate IT operations.

Let's discuss some commands to interact with file share using Command Shell (`CMD`) and `PowerShell`. The command [dir](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/dir) displays a list of a directory's files and subdirectories.
#### Windows CMD - DIR

```powershell
dir \\192.168.220.129\Finance\
```
The command [net use](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/gg651155\(v=ws.11\)) connects a computer to or disconnects a computer from a shared resource or displays information about computer connections. We can connect to a file share with the following command and map its content to the drive letter `n`.

#### Windows CMD - Net Use

```powershell
net use n: \\192.168.220.129\Finance
```

We can also provide a username and password to authenticate to the share.

```powershell
net use n: \\192.168.220.129\Finance /user:plaintext Password123
```

With the shared folder mapped as the `n` drive, we can execute Windows commands as if this shared folder is on our local computer. Let's find how many files the shared folder and its subdirectories contain.
#### Windows CMD - DIR

We found 29,302 files. Let's walk through the command:

```powershell
dir n: /a-d /s /b | find /c ":\"
```

|**Syntax**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`dir`|Application|
|`n:`|Directory or drive to search|
|`/a-d`|`/a` is the attribute and `-d` means not directories|
|`/s`|Displays files in a specified directory and all subdirectories|
|`/b`|Uses bare format (no heading information or summary)|
The following command `| find /c ":\\"` process the output of `dir n: /a-d /s /b` to count how many files exist in the directory and subdirectories. You can use `dir /?` to see the full help. Searching through 29,302 files is time consuming, scripting and command line utilities can help us speed up the search. With `dir` we can search for specific names in files such as:

- cred
- password
- users
- secrets
- key
- Common File Extensions for source code such as: .cs, .c, .go, .java, .php, .asp, .aspx, .html.

```powershell
dir n:\*cred* /s /b
dir n:\*secret* /s /b
```
#### Windows CMD - Findstr

```powershell
findstr /s /i cred n:\*.*
```
#### Windows PowerShell

PowerShell was designed to extend the capabilities of the Command shell to run PowerShell commands called `cmdlets`. Cmdlets are similar to Windows commands but provide a more extensible scripting language. We can run both Windows commands and PowerShell cmdlets in PowerShell, but the Command shell can only run Windows commands and not PowerShell cmdlets. Let's replicate the same commands now using Powershell.
#### Windows PowerShell

```powershell
Get-ChildItem \\192.168.220.129\Finance\
```

Instead of `net use`, we can use `New-PSDrive` in PowerShell.

```powershell
New-PSDrive -Name "N" -Root "\\192.168.220.129\Finance" -PSProvider "FileSystem"
```

To provide a username and password with Powershell, we need to create a [PSCredential object](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.management.automation.pscredential). It offers a centralized way to manage usernames, passwords, and credentials.
#### Windows PowerShell - PSCredential Object

```powershell
$username = 'plaintext'
$password = 'Password123'
$secpassword = ConvertTo-SecureString $password -AsPlainText -Force
$cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential $username, $secpassword
New-PSDrive -Name "N" -Root "\\192.168.220.129\Finance" -PSProvider "FileSystem" -Credential $cred
```

In PowerShell, we can use the command `Get-ChildItem` or the short variant `gci` instead of the command `dir`.
#### Windows PowerShell - GCI

```powershell
N: 

PS N:\> (Get-ChildItem -File -Recurse | Measure-Object).Count
```

We can use the property `-Include` to find specific items from the directory specified by the Path parameter.

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Path N:\ -Include *cred* -File
```

The `Select-String` cmdlet uses regular expression matching to search for text patterns in input strings and files. We can use `Select-String` similar to `grep` in UNIX or `findstr.exe` in Windows.

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Path N:\ | Select-String "cred" -List
```

CLI enables IT operations to automate routine tasks like user account management, nightly backups, or interaction with many files. We can perform operations more efficiently by using scripts than the user interface or GUI.
#### Linux

Linux (UNIX) machines can also be used to browse and mount SMB shares. Note that this can be done whether the target server is a Windows machine or a Samba server. Even though some Linux distributions support a GUI, we will focus on Linux command-line utilities and tools to interact with SMB. Let's cover how to mount SMB shares to interact with directories and files locally.
#### Linux - Mount

```shell
sudo mkdir /mnt/Finance
sudo mount -t cifs -o username=plaintext,password=Password123,domain=. //192.168.220.129/Finance /mnt/Finance
```

As an alternative, we can use a credential file.

```shell
mount -t cifs //192.168.220.129/Finance /mnt/Finance -o credentials=/path/credentialfile
```

The file `credentialfile` has to be structured like this:

As an alternative, we can use a credential file:

```shell
mount -t cifs //192.168.220.129/Finance /mnt/Finance -o credentials=/path/credentialfile # The file contains credencials
```

>[!Note]
>We need to install `cifs-utils` to connect to an SMB share folder. To install it we can execute from the command line `sudo apt install cifs-utils`.
#### Linux - Find

```shell
find /mnt/Finance/ -name *cred*
```

Next, let's find files that contain the string `cred`:

```shell
grep -rn /mnt/Finance/ -ie cred
```
#### Linux - Install Evolution

```shell
sudo apt-get install evolution
```

>[!Note]
If an error appears when starting evolution indicating "bwrap: Can't create file at ...", use this command to start evolution `export WEBKIT_FORCE_SANDBOX=0 && evolution`.
